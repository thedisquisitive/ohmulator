<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>Ohmulator is an open-source project for learning and fun, and we want to make sure it stays that way for everyone! We ask everyone in the community to be respectful, kind, and helpful.</p>

<h2>Our Promise</h2>
<p>We, as members of the Ohmulator community, pledge to make this project a safe and welcoming space for everyone, no matter their background or experience level. Whether you're a student, a hobbyist, or just curious about electronics, you're welcome here!</p>

<h2>What We Expect</h2>
<p>We expect community members to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Be friendly and respectful in discussions, whether they’re on GitHub, in comments, or elsewhere.</li>
    <li>Help others if you can. We're all here to learn!</li>
    <li>Accept feedback gracefully and provide feedback kindly.</li>
    <li>Keep things fun and enjoyable for everyone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What’s Not Cool</h2>
<p>Here are a few things that aren’t okay:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Being rude or disrespectful to others.</li>
    <li>Posting offensive, inappropriate, or harmful content.</li>
    <li>Making anyone feel unwelcome or uncomfortable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If Things Go Wrong</h2>
<p>If someone is behaving inappropriately or making the project less fun for others, you can report it by contacting us at <a href="mailto:contact@ohmulator.org">contact@ohmulator.org</a>. We'll do our best to address the situation and make sure everyone feels welcome.</p>

<h2>It's All About Fun and Learning</h2>
<p>Ohmulator is a casual, fun project, so let's keep the spirit light and positive. Mistakes happen, and that’s okay — we’re all learning together!</p>
